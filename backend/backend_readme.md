# Backend - Coding Platform (Django REST Framework)

This is the **backend** of the full-stack coding platform built with **Django**, **Django REST Framework**, and **Celery** for asynchronous code evaluation. It provides APIs for user authentication, problem management, and submission handling, including secure code execution using subprocesses.
